nesting of comp -> putting code of one comp in another comp              

props - are used to transfer the data from one comp to another comp in an application ( typically from parent comp to child comp's)
       helps diff components of the app to talk to eachother 
       reuse comp with diff data/info  
       props = properties of the comp

ex:

function ParentComponent(){
<ChildComponent lunchBox='roti' drink='jira' />   / passing data 
}

function ChildComponent(props){                   / reciving data inside child and using it further 
}
