nesting of comp -> putting code of one comp in another comp              

props - are used to transfer the data from one comp to another comp in an application ( typically from parent comp to child comp's)
       helps diff components of the app to talk to eachother 
       reuse comp with diff data/info  
       props = properties of the comp

   in simple -  proprities that we transfer from parent comp to child comp 

ex:

function ParentComponent(){
<ChildComponent lunchBox='roti' drink='jira' />   / passing data 
}

function ChildComponent(props){                   / reciving data inside child and using it further 
}


/////////////////////////////// remove ai extension in vs code 


profile and avatar --> reuse comp with diff data/info  ( reusing avatar comp for rendring multiple diff data ) 


event handling - in response to any event when you want to calll an function 

<button onClick={handleClick} >i am a button </button>  // handleClick() should not be written like this inside jsx bcoz it will automatically call the function even withouth specified event is triggred 

always use just function name inside jsx { }
